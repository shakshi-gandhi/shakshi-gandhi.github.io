    <p class="description">
      This dashboard <i>[linked]</i> enables brand managers to make data-driven decisions by allowing filters by state and city to identify which pizza sizes and types are performing best - or underperforming - in specific regions. These insights can be used to create targeted marketing strategies, such as offering promotional coupons or BOGO deals to boost underperforming items based on revenue goals. When integrated with sales data, the dashboard also helps diagnose issues like declining sales potentially caused by high preparation or delivery delays, giving teams the opportunity to improve operations and customer satisfaction.
